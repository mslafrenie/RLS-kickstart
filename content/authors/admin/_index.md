Perfectionism Plunge is a project aimed at identifying perfectionism in all aspects of our lives and unpacking how it helps and hinders our success.

**Research Goals:** 

-  Identifying and defining perfectionism in our lives
-  Highlighting resources and strategies for managing perfectionism
-  Creating a space for reflection

**Important Takeaways:**

-  Perfectionism isn't all or nothing. It has its benefits and flaws.
-  Perfect is not real. Good enough works.
-  Focusing on the process is just as important as the result. The joy is in the details.
