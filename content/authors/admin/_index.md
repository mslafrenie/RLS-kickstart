In the modern world, it is all too common to believe that there is a “perfect” life or lifestyle that must be obtained to feel fulfilled. But achieving perfection isn’t easy or possible. When we strive for perfection we often lose sight of our goals and pour all of our energy into the results which stop us from enjoying the process. In order to explore who we want to be it is crucial that we look inwards at the effects that our actions, self-talk, and current strategies have on our development and well-being. Are you ready to take the plunge?


**Program Theme:**

-  Self-Care & Role Modeling


**Learning Outcomes:**

-  Participants in this workshop will be able to identify two ways that perfectionism manifests in their roles personally and professionally.
-  By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to describe the three different types of perfectionism that can affect individuals personally and in their communities.
-  By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to discuss two strategies that they can utilize to help overcome negative self-talk.
